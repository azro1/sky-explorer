Initially was a vanilla javascript app that made request to an external weather api but came across issue with publicly exposing apikey so created an express server specifically to hide apikey - had to get user input from front-end and send to server via post request, recieve at server (in routes) then make weather api requests - (this had to be done twice as the weather api requires 2 api calls - the first to get the location / city which contains a location key to then make a subsequent request to get the weather for that particular location / city) 

after both calls are made and both sets of data are returned to front-end and data is displayed in UI - tried to host on Netlify as it's a static site with a server but came across issue where can't make post request from front-end to a express server in Netlify you have to use AWS serverless Lambda functions so had to delete server file and re-construct App.js (component making posts to server) - specify a netlify.toml config file and a netlify folder called functions to create function files which request can be made to using filenames as endpoints
